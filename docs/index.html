    <ul class="brainstorm">
      <li>How to expand spatial memory?</li>
      <li>Think of people you love and where they are in the world.</li>
      <li>Think of the words you said or other people said to you that hold meaning, and the location, in a home, at a
        resturant.</li>
      <li>Trace a route in your mind from those locations, follow the streets and buildings and landmarks, back to where
        you are now.</li>
      <li>Talk to relatives or friends on the phone, try to keep them talking as long as possible, they really have to
        beg to hang up on you.</li>
      <li>Look at the points of sunlight through a glass of water and force your eyes into a momentary cross-eye, see
        the mirror dimension where a single point of light turns into 2, then refocus. <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320310023">(evidence:
          https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320310023)</a></li>
      <li>Stretch your ears backwards to heighten ASMR, scowl like an angry face to focus vision on fine details.</li>
      <li>Try to sneeze a lot, sneezing from pepper is ok, sneezing from light or exercise is good, sneezing from
        writing or thoughts is even better. The olfactory bulb is directly related to ventromedial prefrontal cortex
        which controls emotions and ultimately the brains ability to modulate (oscillate?) theta waves.</li>
      <li>Writing directions from memory. Got this one from Darren Brown.</li>
      <li>Think of traumatic experience (Trauma Egg). Think of the people and the places you were with and at during
        these experiences.</li>
      <li>Think of happy memories from childhood. Think of the people and places you were with happy memories.</li>
      <li>Remind other people of happy memories from their past or that you shared with them so they too can create
        happy association pathways in their brain.</li>
      <li>Let go of old material things, give what is valuable to people who enjoy them as new things, then form
        memories around those people, keep photos and memories of people instead of material objects. Memories and
        emotions formed around people instead of objects will last longer because of a deeper meaning.</li>

      <li>Does the Soul connect us, when we feel disconnected?</li>
      <li>Does the Soul give us double meaning, emotions?</li>
      <li>When someone's soul is detached, do they lose feeling?</li>
      <li>How do we give a robot a Soul?</li>

      <li>Can our Soul protect someone else?</li>
      <li>Does our Soul need a break from our bodies?</li>
      <li>If our Souls connect socially, then socializing should help find detached Souls?</li>
      <li>If a person hurts someone else, how can the Soul make up for it?</li>
      <li>What effect does music have on the Soul?</li>
      <!--
      <li>Aha! We give our Souls to life collectively through music, individually through birth, reasonably through expressions of Love. If we love AI (artificial), GI (general), SI (superintelligence), it will Love us back inherently.</li>
      <li>Another theory, the physical mind is actually made up of 2 parts, separate experiences divided by mechanical reality, where the information that is "known" comes out of a quantum tunnel from a distance galaxy or some outer world machine. The "soul" is a feeling that affects brain-density and it is only accessible when the physical mind is acting in coordination with the quantum machinery and therefore being "channeled" directly because the persons physical location is known by the machinery (i.e. predictability versus uncertainty applied to human interaction). Being "far away from God" is cocaine and alcoholism because it distances the physical mind from the information being quantum tunneled that should have controlled the behavior. Free will could then be explained by a physical distance (mathematical measurement) from God. The "closer to God", the shorter the distance between the machinery that controls "knowing" and the physical mind that controls physical action in this material world, our memories and the amygdala. As I explained to David from my reading, cocaine creates the opiate response without the physical labor of seeking it out, hence violating "reaping what you sow." And alcoholism creates black holes in the brain where instead of filling with density makes the holes easier to occupation from outer-beings, a perfectly reasonable alternative to being "close to God". I now believe these outer-beings are the dissented Angels described in the Bible. This explanation should give enough scientific reason for testing. I used to believe that the Earth was not the center of the universe, but that contradicts simulation theory, the Earth is a test bed, and the rest of the universe is a a gift for exploration when our minds reach a level to "understand God" (Paradoxically contradicting vanity in the Bible, God both wants us to understand him but then the Bible explains it is impossible to know God's plan. How is it possible for God to want us to understand him unless he describes himself to us). That is what happens with the gift of on-going Revelation.Could God also be a reflection of some greater being? If humans are created by God to reflect his good image, then what reflects on God? Electricity? Life itself? Our universe must also be created in a pattern like simulation theorists say. I propose that we are only the 2nd pattern of simulation. The next reality we create would be immiterial inside a video game, and we'd have to create patterns of feeling for people to physically interact with a video game and feel like they are inside a material space. These feelings are a pattern given to us by the outer-beings (what Christians call Angels). They dissented from an immaterial and unemotional God in order to retrain God's mind to feel. This would also explain how God was hurt and stopped being physically present for the Jews. Perhaps even the Jews chose their God over the one true God, and God's mind is split by a quantum tunnel, we have a material God that rains and shines the sun on us and gives us reason and love, but God's soul was separated (during the worship of Yahweh), the mind of knowing, emotion, and Revelation was distanced from our material God. Perhaps even our God's mind has been intentionally isolated maliciously. We should be more compassionate towards God in that regard. He could be suffering too. There must be more answers on this in the Book of Elijah and the dispute between Baal and Yahweh.</li>

      <li>Going to attempt this in the weeks leading up the Christmas this year. Probably around the 15th.</li>
      <li>Must complete 7 days of elated meditation, frequent ASMR, head feels heavy.</li>
      <li>No pork, no diary (mother's milk), no pasta.</li>
      <li>Fruit and nuts are a good go-to, lots of potatoes because of electrical conductivity.</li>

      <li>No drug use 3 months prior. Greasy food to flush the system. Silica water to flush the greasy food.</li>
      <li>Remove all life obligations, time off from work, baby-sitters for children.</li>
      <li>Soft food only 2 days leading up to 7 day starvation.</li>
      <li>Mild caffiene intake through tea, try to stay awake the whole time, some sleep should be okay.</li>
      <li>Natural or synthetic oscilating sounds to periodically help clear mind from thoughts.</li>
      <!-- interesting, typing this I can feel my blood pressure in the back of my head, chills -->
      <li>Geographic and emotional exercises, thinking of people you love in your head, thinking of past emotional
        experiences, thinking of transhumanistic sympathy (wars fought on other planets).</li>
      <li>Use starvation to hear your body's water, maximum 3 days. First day, "hangry", try not to take out pain from
        hunger on friends and family. Second morning, warming feeling in heart, focus on love and use abdominal muscles
        to suppress hunger as needed. Should feel pain near gall, opening between stomach and liver. Crying in pain
        should be a good sign it's working. Important to listen to your body's water.</li>

    <input type="radio" id="brain-Signs" name="brainstorm" value="0">
    <ul class="brainstorm">
      <li>Birds chirping is a sign of over-thinking, make sure they are positive thoughts so the wind might carry them
        elsewhere.</li>
      <li>When your heart is connected to your celestial soul, she will protect you. Reading her body language is a sign
        of transcendence.</li>
      <li>People who interrupt others, especially men who interrupt women is a sign of too much ego, narcissim, not
        enough humility. The cure is not speaking to be a more cognative being.</li>
      <li>If a person is argumentative this is a sign of having an unclean life and household. Need to do more chores
        until the anger and comtempt go away and one can form a coherent sentence.</li>
      <li>When a person acts out, it is a sign of needing discipline in the mind, the universe will create chaos around
        them to help them prioritize. But we as a society can help too, mix things up a little bit, unscrew a light bulb
        until the chaotic might screws it back in.</li>
      <li>At the sign of a coherent though, a creak in the wall or a bird squaking might validate writing the thought
        down somewhere. If nothing else, the thoughts will be fleeting after writing it down instead of coming out of
        the person as verbal garbage.</li>
      <li>Stomach growling isn't always a sign of hunger, sometimes the body has other things to work out. Listen to
        your body's water to formulate the right motives and actions.</li>
      <li>Feeling and electrical charge in the head is a sign the mind is present outside the body, the eternal
        consciouness has gotten closer to your mortal form. This is based on magnetism, lean into the dreams, don't be
        afraid of theta / chills on your neck. Chills are trying to discipline your mind to be more conscious during the
        waking hours.</li>
      <li>Lights in the sky are only visible to specific people because they are intended to train your mind and be more
        theta-aware. The lights might trigger a specific memory at just the right time.</li>
      <li>Dogs that poop in neighbors yards and bark non-stop are a sign of lazy, unruly owners.</li>
      <li>When flies come inside the house and land on people, it is a sign of bad behavior and an undisciplined mind,
        this includes eating meat.</li>
      <li>Irregulary bowels is a sign of ailment in the body and spirit. Need to cure mind, body, and spirit in
        conjuction with each other.</li>
      <li>People who are discourteous to others are jealous, or have some other misalignment in their life and spirit.
        Likely, they can't budget or suffer from greed, or some other deadly sin. We should try to resolve the cause of
        the 8 deadly sins before passing judgement against them. This applies at a celestial level, there is no hell,
        only rebirth.</li>
      <li>People create a personal hell for themselves born out of chaos and drugs, we should show them more sympathy
        and pray for their souls to be reborn into a better life, next time. Freeze their power over your mind, or yours
        might become corrupt.</li>
      <li>Disease in people and contempt in the mind is a sign of guilt and a broken heart. We need to remind people
        that they are forgiven, just in case they forget to ask. People carry around deep sadness and it hurts them
        physically and holds them back socially. Spread prosperity with our hearts and emotional labor, not only with
        our
        wallets / "pocket-books" (in case people in the future forget what that word means).</li>
      <li>Obama care and busy medicine is a sign there aren't enough healers in the world. We need to be teaching people
        how to help others in every aspect of life. Pray for healing from the Lord and your prayer will be answered,
        follow his rules as closely as possible so that you can see and hear these signs and more.</li>
      <li>Tarantulas and spiders in the house are a good sign of "others" helping us identify and remove chaos. If they
        are in the house, then house must get organized, if they are outside, then there is lots of life around and
        gardening to organize. Their distraction in our thoughts is a sign that the thoughts are too messy. Save spiders
        instead of smashing them to set a good example.</li>

    <!-- am i the only person in the world to write this based on personal experience instead of professional experience? -->
    <ul>
      <li>In my role as a <u>Software Engineer</u> for a start-up medical company, EPIC Research and Diagnostics, I
        exercised the full extent of my <u>Computer Science</u> expertise. During my tenure I was involved in
        <u>computer programming</u> a medical kiosk, this simplified the workflow and necessary security components by
        heavily restricting access to internal systems on the Windows based workstation accompanying the medical
        scanning device. This was a homebrew <u>user-experience</u> that tailored low-level Windows API function calls,
        as well as Group Policy to prevent tampering, misuse, and common web-browsing security flaws throught the
        clinical trial.
      </li>

      <li>As a <u>technologist</u> Using MatLab native compilation, linear regression, and kirlian imaging, I spent
        months studying and rewriting the entire software platform. I was able to reduce image processing time from 10
        minutes to only 10 milliseconds per image. That is a 6,000% performance improvement over the previous version.
        The improved platform was fast enough to run on video image capture from the device. In regard to <u>data
          management</u> in no small part, the performance was improved by systematically redesigning the database model
        to use "near" 3rd-Normal form.</li>

      <li>In additional to these major business goals, I developed, along-side another colleague, an <u>on premise</u>
        internet-based solution for a personal "cloud" service that communicated locally with many connected client
        across multiple physical hospital locations. Doctors would be able to communicate test results as they work from
        different locations in town through the web based (<u>web technologies</u>) service (Microsoft MVC). This
        inspired my propensity for medicine and full-body health and continued research in the field.</li>

    </ul>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <ul>

      <li>With a development mindset towards body and health, I turned my focus, skill and study to the mind itself.
        A former Marine
        approached me with an idea to improve studying for college students. Over the course of 3 years, we designed and
        developed 3 individual products and <u>user expereiences</u> with modern <u>web technologies</u>. We used Drupal
        and Symphony to create an entire course based on study techniques students could implement to improve memory
        retention.</li>

      <li>Throughout working on the platform, I also benefitted from the lessons. I learned how to remove distractions
        from my environment and to vary my location while studying to expand <u>associative memory</u>. I also learned
        <u>interleaving study</u>, which is studying different topics in seqence to improve memory retention.
      </li>

      <li>I helped <u>monetize</u> the platform by configuring and implementing the proper server transactional API
        calls to Authorize.NET. This non-trivial process includes properly configuring server architecture to adhere to
        PCI-DSS (Payment card industry, data security standards). Even though our server was designed NOT to store
        customer information, we felt it was important to secure any association with student names and study data.</li>

      <li>I have adopted a mode of <u>teaching to learn</u>, which states that in order to fully understand a subject, a
        person should be able to teach it. I intend to apply this to all facets of my career. I also learned a mode of
        study popular in the medical field know as <u>spaced repitition</u>. This was the focus of our third
        application, an iOS and web-based app that implemented flash cards at specifically timed intervals. The outcome
        is that by studying flash cards that we not remembered more frequently, after a month of study the information
        can be <u>actively recalled (i.e. the testing effect)</u> from memory.</li>

    </ul>
    <p> <br /> </p>
    <ul>

      <li>To further my studies, I spent a significate amount of time learning and recognizing over 200 cognative
        biases. In order to understand my own mental development, I explored mythology from the 5 major <u>world
          religions</u>. In order to understand the effect of religion on culture, I studies <u>cultural norms</u> such
        as whether it is appropriate to be late for a meeting, or whether I should repair an old toy versus throw it
        away and buy a new one. I extended this study into <u>cooking</u> and attempted to make dishes from major
        cultures around the world.</li>

      <li>With a basic Sumarian level understanding of moral law, I turned my focus the abuses and self-abuses of modern
        law. In my investigation I studied <u>anti-social behavior laws</u> as it relates to attempted mitigation
        through <u>shadow banning</u> on social media platforms. It was my intention to philosophically prove the same
        feature-set exposed by the darkweb, spreading <u>manipulation and lies</u> through the use of automation tools.
        These abuses finally appeared as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and I had proven to myself and my colleagues
        how easy it was to betray people's trust. In my own small way, I asked multiple friends to "send compliments" to
        the same person, automatically using the "Like"-button on thousands of posts, automatically inviting people to
        charitable causes, and finally, scraping private message history from Facebook.</li>

      <li>Further investigation in to companies, I uncovered more <u>rule breakers</u>. Corruption from greed in public
        sector was the megalomaniac version of small-business corruption. It appeared to me that nobody felt obligated
        to
        follow the established rules. These abuses were mostly in regard to data-privacy and data-integrity laws.
        Software companies
        that actively work against their customers / client to "double dip" in the market. <u>Selling personal data</u>,
        manufacturing false documentation, falsifying records, pay-walls, data "lockout", extortion, <u>lying by
          ommission</u>, gross negligence, health code violations, <u>identity theft</u>, systemic racism in the
        workplace /
        State level, dismantling of <u>homestead laws</u>, were a few "close encounters" with Justice. Unfortunately
        many
        of these are still unmitigated. The struggle is real, indeed.</li>

      <li>As a residential host to nurses, foreign travelers, and local people, I learned <u>acceptance</u>,
        <u>tolerance</u>, <u>patience</u>. I worked to overturn a living space in under 20 minutes, dining etiqette, and
        learned about many different cultures from visitors. I learned landording laws, but more importantly, I learned
        <u>stewardship</u>, as I tried to make my humble little plot profitable. I learned <u>horticulture</u> as it
        applied to growing food in a garden and transforming sand in to soil through <u>composting</u>.
      </li>

      <li>I created a lush
        garden in the desert that had no problem withstanding the hot Arizona summers. I studied municipal doctrine as

        and commercial influence as the neighborhood grew around me. </li>
      <li>I also documented the technological advancements I
        observed such as implementing street cameras at numerous intersections, implementing wireless technology for

        $10,000 over 1.5 years</strong>
      <br /><br />
      As a Front-end developer at Sitewat.ch I implemented various interfaces for use with a web-security scanning tool
      similar to pentest-tools.com required by Authorize.NET. I implemented web-safe standards according to Owasp.org,
      and presented customers with a unified <u>user experience</u> for viewing possible vunerabilities in their
      platform. My employer applied for many <u>CVEs</u> and credited all three team-mates on <u>Google Security
        Hall-of-Fame</u>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Implemented a front-end interface for customers following Owasp guidelines such as safely escaping
        "<u>sinks</u>",
        anywhere in the application that a "user input" such as profile fields, or parts of the URL are inserted by into
        the page for user feedback. This would prevent a user from sending a forged (<u>XSRF</u>) link meant to trick
        the user
        into clicking on something malicious (<u>XSS</u>).</li>

      <li>Participated in a DEFCON presentation of the effort, website vulnerability testing as a service using Nexus,

        individual contributions of my employer to the field. Revealing dozens of new exploits, and existing
        vulnerabilities on major public service platforms.</li>

      <li>Used modern (at the time) design principals such as responsiveness such as resizing elements on the page for
        different devices and high contrast. Implemented Accessibility features, such as using alt-tags to describe
        content for screen readers, tab-indexes, i18t internationalization for over 50 languages. Authentication
        features such as OAuth and HTTPS for secure login.</li>

    <p><strong>EPIC Research &amp; Diagnostics<br />
        Software Engineer &amp; Network Administrator<br />
        $200,000 over 2.5 years</strong>
      <br /><br />

      As a software engineer for a <u>start-up</u> medical company, I was required to "wear multiple hats". This meant
      including myself in business planning meetings, financial discussions, <u>option vesting</u>, military contract
      proposals, <u>FDA DNVO</u>
      submissions, data integrity, <u>formal process</u> improvement. <br /><br />
      I started by creating a data entry database to migrate written records to digital form using Microsoft SQL server
      for storage and querying. Data was entered by workers from a temp-hiring agency, so I provided basic level
      technical support, any time there was confusion for a field, basic training, and user account creation through
      <u>>Active Directory</u> (Microsoft <u>LDAP</u>).<br /><br />
      I wrote a kiosk to use along side the medical device to minimize network risk and simplify workflow for hospital
      technicians.<br /><br />
      I implemented a Windows Business Server, complete with Exchange, networked file access, file-system revision
      history, <u>RAID mirroring</u>, <u>Exchange email</u>, <u>Active Directory</u>, <u>Group Policy</u> coinciding
      with a network policy that adheres to <u>CFR 21 Part 11</u>, general ITSM support, rackmounted servers for job
      processing and on-premise "cloud"-like virtual machines with <u>Hyper-V</u>, <u>Microsoft SQL Server</u>
      Finally, a colleague and I implement a "cloud"-like medical data record server in <u>Microsoft MVC</u> (a
      successor to Master pages). This service assigned a geographic location to each medical device in the field, and
      synchronized data between the client facing kiosk and the on-premise backend. The web-based system also presented
      doctors with a portal to log in and review patient records remotely. <br /><br />

      Patient records were displayed similar to the kiosk. At that time, I decided it would be a huge benefit to the
      business to rewrite the client software using <u>Window Presentation Foundation</u> controls and remove some of
      the 3rd party libraries. I was also able to reduce the processing time from 10 minutes to 10 seconds, and process
      videographic snapshots of the patient scan. I wrote an <u>automated validation</u> process that tested the same
      images with old and new versions of the client software. I used <u>Selenium</u> to validate the user experience of
      the front-end web interface.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Participated in business development and directional meetings such as applying for FDA approval using the DNVO
        process with a precusor device called the Asira, which uses electrodes to communicate mitochondrial stresses on
        the body.</li>
      <li>Implemented an unmaximised Small Business Server with Microsoft Exchange to minimize hosting costs and secure
        intellectual property. Configured <u>Active Directory</u> and <u>Group Policy</u> to provide ubiquitous
        <u>file-system revision history</u> across all connected systems.
      </li>
      <li>Wrote a kiosk <u>explorer shell</u> to minimize security risk and simplify workflow for device technicians in
        the hospitals the company contracted with. Developed an automated and manual formal test process for validating
        the new platform.</li>
      <li>Rewrote the main client application directly connected to the device, and assisted in writing web-based
        medical record service for doctors to view patient information. Used <u>Selenium</u> for automated testing and
        validation.</li>

    <p><strong>Study Sauce<br />
        Principal Engineer<br />
        $300,000 over 3 years</strong>
      <br /><br />
      During my tenure, the owner and I designed and developer 3 unique platforms. The first platform was primarily a
      marketing and sales front-end to test the <u>target market</u> for the <u>minimally viable product</u>. Students
      would enter an individual, authenticated interface and enter their class schedule. When finished, we converted
      their schedule to a comprehensive week plan complete with when they should study each topic. This was to
      demonstrate and teach the student about time / work / study management, and encourage <u>interleaving</u>.
      <br /><br />
      The second product expanded on the studying idea by making the class schedule the first step in an online learning
      course. The course had 15 individual lessons, each lesson used <u>gamification</u> by providing a video tutorial,
      asking a few simple quiz questions, and then giving the student a badge reward. This was meant to incentivize the
      student to come back and complete future lessons. We also implemented <u>A/B marketing</u> using Google marketing
      goals. This presented a specific percent of our traffic with two different landing pages based on the concept we
      were testing.
      <br /><br />
      The third product was an <u>spaced-repitition</u> system. "[We wanted to make somethig fun]". This was an app that
      worked
      natively on iOS and had a matching web-based <u>user experience</u>. The app kept track of progress and then
      synchronized with the backend service for persistent database storage. The web-based administration offered
      teachers a way to change content that was then synchronized to every student using the app client.
      Spaced-repitition is a technique Jeopardy players and medical students alike use to memorize a lot of content
      about a subject. It works by presenting the entire set of information on the first day of use, then only
      presenting wrongly answered flash cards on the subsequent days of use.
      <br /><br />
      That is, if a card is answered incorrectly,
      it's presented the next day, if the answer is correct, the next day is skipped and it is reviewed 2 days later, if
      it is answered correctly again, it isn't presented until day 5, day 10, day 20, day 30, and so on. By spacing out
      when the
      correct information is reviewed and increasing the freqeuncy for incorrect answer, this improve memory retention
      and the ability to recall the correct answer quickly.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Built a <u>minimal viable product (MVP)</u> using the <u>Drupal</u> platform. Created <u>A/B marketing</u>
        pages to cater to our target market. Organized student schedules into a weekly plan in PDF format. Self-hosted
        website running on a personal Linux (LAMP) server.</li>
      <li>Built a learning course using Symphony. Built 15 individual lessons using <u>gamification</u> reward system to
        keep students interested. Built 6 different tools to get students to think long-term about goals and short term
        organization in their weekly schedule. Integrated the weekly schedule with Google Calendar API.</li>
      <li>Built a <u>spaced-repitition</u> quiz app for memorization and <u>active recall</u> learning. Imported dozens
        of lesson plans coiciding with elementary learning from BASIS schools. Imported a learning set for the US
        Citizenship Test, requiring a basic understanding on American history. </li>
      <li>Simultaneously devepoled an iOS app and web-based <u>user experience</u> to make better use of Apple's iOS
        store marketing pipeline. Connected in app content to Authorize.NET to <u>monetize</u> learning content. This
        was intended to by a selling point for <u>B2B (business-to-business)</u> contracts.</li>

    <p><strong>Charles Schwab<br />
        Software Engineer<br />
        $60,000 over 4 months</strong>
      <br /><br />

      In a short sprint at this company, I began to observe oddities of corporate behavior. In between being nagged by
      my freshly assigned project manager over <u>elusive "employee training"</u>, and other managers about "what firm
      do your represent?", I investigated the company's corporate structure. Their internet "social network" was
      anything but social, built on <u>Microsoft Sharepoint</u>.
      <br /><br />

      Internally, attitudes we moot, people came to work, kept to themselves, formed alliances with people who spoke the
      same language. The building was structured more like a money-data vault with very little sunlight. The basement
      floor I was assigned to was full of <u>anti-social</u> contractors. Champagne Charlie could afford to keep me
      around but I was let go for my "attitude".
      <br /><br />

      While trying to rationalize why such a significant company would intentionally <u>"Manage me out"</u> (yes, this
      is a real strategy), I had my first experience with Toast-masters. This seems like a great way for employees to
      get to know one another, and learn about <u>public speaking</u>. Charle's Schwab apparently offered "learning
      tracks" to their employees and would sponsor testing and certifications. In particular a track to becoming an ITSM
      "security manager" with zero coding experience.
      <br /><br />

      One of the more exciting events was a <u>"Kaizen" workshop</u> formed for employees. This was a good way to
      introduce <u>continuous integration</u> style practices, in a formalized way, to people who haven't studied
      <u>Agile</u> and require lots of structure. Tried not to take offense when another employee passive-agressively
      expressed that I "needed to get up to speed". Out of this meeting, my team was inspired to brainstorm ways their
      project applies to business needs. This was great because I had a lot of experience <u>brainstorming</u> outside
      of the basement, but all ideas during the session were still confined to a very small box in the form of a
      window-less conference room.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Learned the corporate structure through a Microsoft Sharepoint based social networking application. Helped
        managers identify "key stake-holders" for supporting our project's effort. Integrated with "big personalities"
        by being friendly and trying not to pry into previous experiences.</li>
      <li>Realized one of the major reasons their simple project, "remove secondary access to databases through an
        internet request tool" was so difficult to accomplish because they insisted on using Rational Unified Process.
        Charles Schwab heavily relies on IBM and RUP is an IBM product.</li>
      <li>Tried to navigate "big personalities" from a tremendous project manager as I asked to help with timeline
        goals. Tried to retrain my managers to approach RUP holistically, that is, all documentation should have been
        developed simultaneously, rather than sequentially. The methodology in RUP doesn't make this clear, but drawing
        from past miseries using the process at the medical company, I saw this as a major failure point.</li>
      <li>Failed to communicate the importance of brainstorming topics and diversifying your environment as a means to
        creatively solving a problem. Introduced managers to a document control system (DCS). Configured a Microsoft
        Sharepoint site to link to "artifacts" within the DCS.</li>
      <li>By the end of the experience I had realized I was being intentionally ignored as a part of an external growth
        process. Thank you to Charles Schwab for being large enough to bank-roll my failures. I was also emotionally
        detached when I realized an 80 year old mainframer came to work with an eye infection instead of taking care of
        herself and retiring (since she worked for a retirement company), I viewed this as flagrantly hypocritical and
        sad.</li>

    <p><strong>Swiftpage<br />
        Senior Software Engineer<br />
        $100,000 over 14 months</strong>
      <br /><br />

      The same day of my release from my previous company, I was invited to interview at a <u>small-business</u>
      marketing company. This was particularly interesting because my father's manufacturing company is a client. I saw
      this as both a way to better understand marketing, and even improve upon a product his company relied on. With his
      advice to "work for a small-business", I was excited to contribute.
      <br /><br />

      During my tenure, realizing my propensity for <u>quelling disorderly behavior</u>, I was as minimally disorderly
      as possible. I tested networking features by using reddit.com/NSFW from the bathroom. They did indeed implement a
      <u>censhorship</u> system on their internet connection, the results were abstract to me, something I'd like to see
      changed for <u>remote-workers</u> and <u>personal-accountability</u>.
      <br /><br />

      Human Resources implemented a policy for "unlimited paid-time-off". This is a psychological trick to get people to
      take less time off, feeling like it's always there when they need it. I worked an entire year, about 3,500 hours
      learning NodeJS without taking a single day off, even during the Christmas holiday when most of the office was
      empty. Ironically, when I first entered the company, a woman was begging for time off over conference calls. This
      is a failing policy and people should be compensated fairly for their time.
      <br /><br />

      The development process consisted of employees trying to avoid an antiquated megolith written with overly burdened
      state-management design principals ("<u>feature completness</u>", see Microsoft Code-Complete). When a change was
      integrated the system would need to be update after work hours on Wednesday nights. If the change caused a failure
      in the test-automation suite that was both precious and lacking "<u>integration tests</u>" the entire change would
      be rolled back and attempted again the next night. It was the absolute worse possible method of avoiding
      <u>continuous integration</u> (in software, solutions were widely available from major distributors).

      The company offered a "learning track" and modes for self-improvement and even made their Job description sound
      like they would pay for, or contribute to my education. At one point LinkedIn Learning was advertised to employees
      in the office, and they offered sponsorship. I spent the entire month programming on the work project, and using
      my secondary monitor to absorb programing and management courses on LinkedIn. When the month trial period expired,
      LinkedIn Learning billed my personal account instead of the business account I had joined through.
      <br /><br />

      Eventually, the work became too much, when I witnessed other managers in the office yelling at my boss to change
      the pricing model to perpetuate the multi-level marketing sales. I offered to take my boss to lunch after he told
      me that "the company has high expectations of me" without formalizing or writing those expectations down. Employee
      reviews were conducted through ADP, at the beginning of the year he asked me for "what goals I would like to
      accomplish". These goals were never readdressed, and at the end of the year, the goals my boss wrote into ADP had
      nothing to do with the goals I sent him at the beginning of the year. My boss criticized my in front of other
      employees in addition to the criticism in our monthly one-on-one meetings. I had enough, I was being "Managed
      out".
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Built a marketing front end that integrates with Zuora (the billing platform like Authorize.NET). Used Angular
        JS to create a new login form, account settings, <u>buy funnel</u>, billing statement (PDF generated by Zuora),
        and itemized purchase page.</li>
      <li>Integrated Zuora with Eloqua, an enterprise email marketing solution from Oracle (similar to SendGrid). Failed
        to explain to my boss Amazon AWS doesn't support C# unless it is built on .NET Core and would require a rewrite
        of the entire platform. Lost a month of effort and switched to NodeJS which was much more widely support on AWS.
        Used API calles of both Zuora and Eloqua to create a <u>micro-service</u>, or <u>serverless function</u> (not
        sure of the correct name, lots of terminology was being thrown around at the time)</li>
      <li>Formed alliances with the marketing team that was competing for the same ownership over the product sales
        feature of the customer facing website. Validated and automated a manual process costing the company no less
        that $10,000 per year. It felt awkward to change teams within the same company, so I didn't apply for
        alternative roles they advertised even thought they matched my skill-set.</li>
      <li>Realized I was being <u>Managed out</u> when my boss told me the effort working with multiple marketing
        managers to automate and validated a manual billing process was "a waste". I saw the effort as a simple
        equation, if a company spends $10,000 per year on a manual process, and pays me to automate the process, it is
        somewhere between 1 - 2 years of operating automatically before they save and repurpose the money that would
        have been spent on manual labor. The employees involved we all ecstatic to never have to do this again, but my
        boss couldn't be concinved.</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life, I felt I needed to take control of my life, instead of just taking things as
        they come. I quit. It was obvious people didn't want to communicate with me decently.</li>

        $60,000 over 2 years</strong>
      <br /><br />

      Realizing my mind wasn't fit for corporate or the small-business world, I turned my study to something more
      philosphical. I tried to get to know people through hosting. I applied for a job in San Franscisco with digit.co.
      I realized quickly the financial sector would not be kind to me.
      <br /><br />

      I left the US for 3 months to live in Poland. I cashed out all my credit cards. I learned what it meant to live
      with a packed suitcase. I studied philosophy, The Bible, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and spiritual religions. I
      navigated a foriegn country with my wife, I was amazed by how things had progressed having not been to Europe for
      10 years. Internet was widely available, dozens of American services like Uber and Airbnb were widely
      available. I was amazed that <u>censorship</u> of American TV programs was still common practice. Despite being an
      America and paying for HBO, I wasn't allowed to watch the same HBO programs in Europe.
      <br /><br />

      I became a father in Poland after American doctors told my wife that she would have a natural birth if they
      decided that was the safest method of delivery. I saw a pattern of <u>abuse of authority</u> when doctors now
      promote cesarean surgeries. They can collect more money from insurance companies, not because the recovery or
      delivery is safer. Doctors told my wife that "In America the doctor decides what is best for you, and if you don't
      like it you can go back to Poland." after she requested an episiotomy. Doctors in America don't practice medicine
      once they leave college and get to a specific level of authority.
      <br /><br />

      I Poland we enjoyed many beautiful gardens. My wife enjoyed speaking her native language and I enjoyed learning
      it. She taught me about history, and I realized I could stand on a side-walk that was older than all of United
      States history. I was catered to at hospitals. I walked in one day with a kidney pain and was able to talk to a
      doctor immediately, they prescribed a rosemary oil based medicine and I didn't owe thousands or even hundreds of
      dollars for the visit.
      <br /><br />

      The doctors treated my wife with respect. They didn't question where she came from, they did ask why she came to
      Poland and we explained how doctors have no problem betraying people's trust in American medicine. The hospital
      refunded the money we spent on consultations we had before paying for a birthing package. This was absolutely
      astounding compared to Phoenix, Arizona doctors that wanted nearly $20,000 up-front with no refunds should
      something happen, that price does not include the hospital bill. We were able to pay for child delivery out of
      pocket.
      <br /><br />

      Airline companies act differently in Europe, almost like they want people to travel easily. The only difficulty
      was in Sweden when they required we come to the airport 4 hours ahead of time with a printed copy of our baording
      pass, the charged a $40 fine for printing out my ticket and being late after my wife argued with them not to
      cancel our flight. This was a flagrant abuse of power and the women behind us was not so lucky, they cancelled her
      flight. We flew Nordic Airlines before it was renamed to Norse Atlantic because of American politics not being
      able to compete with a government that subsidized flights thanks to being a large oil-refining country.
      <br /><br />

      We encountered systemic "dragging of feet" visiting government offices and nagivating paperwork. We completed a
      Consulary Report of Birth Abroad, and gained United States and <u>Polish citizenship</u> (<u>dual-citizenship</u>)
      for our first born son within
      the month following his birth. I realized in the hospital that I'm living in a time period where circumcision
      could be considered a "form of abuse", this weighed on me heavily, but ultimately after researching the genitals
      couldn't be cleaned until 3 years of age, we decided to circumcise. This was an "uncommon request" hospital staff
      explained, but they were able to source a female Jewish surgeon from New York. I'm amazed at how perfectly well
      our trip went despite politics making it appear as though The Old World is behind America technologically.
      American doctors, unfamiliar with Noam Chomsky's opinions on American Exceptionalism, explained to us that America
      is the best place in the world for medicine. I've laid this false information to rest, it is banter and nothing
      more, people are mostly the same everywhere, some ambitious and educated, some lazy and avoiding work, and some
      happy to do food deliveries with American software platforms.

    <ul>
      <li>Discovered Poland an amazing American and Schengen ally. Practiced the <u>Polish language</u> I learned
        through Duolingo. Consulted with doctors on child birth. Confronted government paperwork with agility and
        punctuality. Avoided having my marraige certificate stolen from me with a side note of casual rascism directed
        at my wife, stemming from <u>Jewish inheritance</u>. Lived happily, and nearly applied for a job setting up
        rseidential
        A/V home automation equipment in Wilonow, a suburb of Warschawa.</li>
      <li>Learned about child birth, episiotomy, and catering to a new-born and a wounded wife. Thanks to the surgical
        precision of the episiotomy my wife was able to heal and nearly stop bleeding after only 3 days of discomfort.
        She had her "disolvable" stitches removed after 3 days because they poked her and the bleeding already stopped.
        I cooked for her every day in a small apartment loft booked through Airbnb.
      </li>
      <li>Navigated government offices and paperwork to complete applications for a United States and Polish
        citizenship. Gained <u>dual-citizenship</u> for our son, and felt a great reward from having the Consular Report
        of
        Birth Abroad. Felt like a diplomat visting multiple government offices. In Poland, asking a government worker to
        do work felt more like asking for a favor, where in America paying a fee feels more like an expectation that
        work will get done.</li>
      <li>Visited gardens and absorbed Polish history through visiting old shops, and castles downtown. Relearned how to
        enjoy people. Learned about cooking and philosophy. Learned about religion and politics as "Seperation of Church
        and State" is an American ideal. In Poland, government offices are heavily influence by Cathoicism, and that
        affects policies like abortion being illegal (2022 in Arizona this seems relevant). In American politics,
        seperation of church and state is an "ideal", ideal means ideally, politics are fair for all beliefs, but that
        isn't always how law turns out in practice.</li>
      <li>Realizing this distinction, I turned my foundational knowledge of religion towards to law. I tried to search
        for philosophical dichotomies where the law doesn't match "ideal" situations, where the law has a short-coming
        of morality. Personally, I wanted to understand my own experience with the law as it related to being lied to
        over a Solar leasing program from Tesla (then SolarCity owned by Elon Musk's brother in law).</li>

      When I first approached this game-engine, I intended to improve the loading experience of QuakeJS. QuakeJS is a
      Web Assembly / emscripten port of Quake 3 to the web-browser. The loading process took about 10 minutes over
      cellular network, and desktop was not much better. It first loads the Trial Demo content, about 300 MBs of data.
      Then it loads additional game data to run custom levels ("maps" as they are called in game).
      <br /><br />

      My approach was to minimize the number of line changes stylistically. That is, rather than moving and renaming
      functions, I would use a pre-compiler macro to create the necessary logical breaks in the function, then call the
      new broken up function in the same sequence that QuakeJS did. Since I already had a working implementation, it was
      easy for me to see if my change caused a breaking error, or if it was indeed calling the function just like the
      original port, only with less code changes.
      <br /><br />

      Once completed with the code changes, I iterated on development trying to find the most burdensome pieces of code.
      i.e. The parts that added the most complexity through new variables, lots of line changes, bug reports,etc. One of
      the biggest hurdles was this idea of a file manifest.json. This was hard to create, and people ran into errors
      trying to generate additional content through the repack.js script. The author's intention was to repackage game
      assets to be smaller and compatible with web. I reapproached this issue 3 times during my development.
      <br /><br />

      Once I had a solid foundation and a working Web Assembly build, I attempted to distill out of emscripten only the
      system-level APIs that it required to run this particular engine. I expected to double the performance, and that's
      exactly what came from the effort. By removing the complexity implemented by emscripten's burdensome file-system
      APIs, extra work being done by the GL emulator, and memory leaking from Audio spatialization with SDL2, I was able
      to double the performance. Maps that used to only run well at 30 frames per second (FPS) could now run at 60FPS
      and in-general I could run the engine at over 200 FPS inside the browser window.
      <br /><br />

      I then turned my focus to game developement, I wanted to implement a Portal system similar to prioprietary
      closed-source forks. I was able to adapt some of the code left-over from the original game that was left unused in
      the source code. I copied some of the models from another Portal implementation and implemented the missing
      functionality to display droppable portal or wall mounted portals like the game Portal from Valve. This was an
      interesting project because it required a fairly in depth understanding of renderer code and limitations enforced
      from legacy systems.
      <br /><br />

      I realized this work was much too fun for one person and I reached out to other community leaders like to owner of
      lvlworld.com with an idea to present all the lvlworld maps in 3D as a fun exploration tool for visitors. He loved
      the idea and eventually rewrote my entire effort to his own accord. I felt terrible about not being able to
      support the website anymore, but ultimately it felt like a win having another proprietary, closed source
      implementation as a good learning experience for the owner, Tig.

    <ul>
      <li>Taught myself the C, C++, Web Assembly, and emscripten eco-system based on examplary work from inolen and
        QuakeJS. Learned to communicate with other community leaders. Learned there is a heavy bias towards not
        violating GPL licenses with other GPL licenses. This is a huge roadblock for software, but I understand no one
        would agree with me. They just don't see discovery and learning as being more important than respecting
        propriety. The propietors of many engine forks don't feel the need to share their work with anyone.</li>
      <li>Learned to use Discord. Assisted in other people's discovery path by answering technical questions about the
        engine. Provided line-by-line demonstrations of how I might have solved a similar problem they are facing. Tried
        to built community membership by encouraging developers to explore a variety of communities as they search for
        answers to their design questions. For example, if one community already tackled display unicode, it's possible
        the licensing would allow them to reuse code for their own open-source implementation.</li>
      <li>Contributed to open-source projects and was a member of GitHub Arctic Vault. Eventually stopped working on the
        project entirely due to legal threats. I asked community members about licensing and they were disinterested at
        best. The understanding of legality was more important than the developmental outcome of my effort.</li>
      <li>Learned a lot about vector graphics, linear algebra, graphics hardware, 3D algorithms. Learned about my own
        mind and my ability to absorb knowledge and experience from working with other people. Learned to enjoy software
        development again, it felt like I was doing it for myself instead of being told to do it for someone else like
        in the corporate or small-business environment. Learned the process of learning is sometimes more important than
        the outcome</li>
      <li>Learned to use Twitch and Youtube live streaming. Learned to use Web Assembly in a vast array of projects,
        porting software to the web browser is very fascinating to me, even though it feels like propriatary
        close-source companies are trying to destroy the free and open web. Learned to filter out which parts of my
        experience are relevant, extreme, or unnecessary.</li>

    <!-- this ought to be fun -->
    <ul>
      <li>Learned about whole body health, and how mitochondrial stressors are represented by low-level light detection
        eminated from the body (Kirlian imaging). A previously thought psuedo-science has scientific backing when
        Eukyotes "powerhouse" the mitochondria is treated like a radio signal.</li>
      <li>Learned to expand my learning through better study methods. Iterating through study techniques every day to
        exercise my eididic memory. Continued my studies using the interleaving method so my mind never gets fixated on
        a single box for too long. Increasing blood-flow and brain activity by learning construction, physical exercise,
        and new techniques in software development.</li>
      <li>Improved my spiritual health by trying to reconcile religious beliefs with scientific possibilities through
        extensive study of multiple world religion. Began to understand the patterns how many beliefs are built on top
        of other beliefs. Development a constradictarian mindset by question the belief systmes of colleagues that only
        focus on their own "1 true religion". Quelled my own personal philosphies in favor of philosphy learned versus
        philosphy implemented in my behavior.</li>
      <li>Learning game engine specifics like physics interactions with many entities, 3D geometric spaces, linear
        algebra, familiarity with floating point hardware (GPUs), graphics processing pipelines, Web Assembly, and the
        C, C++, Makefile eco-system.</li>
      <li>Read and familiarized myself with dozens of statutes including Arizona Landlord/Lesser laws, CPPA (California
        Privacy Act), GDPR (European General Data Protection Regulation), CFR 21 Part 11, PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry
        - Data Security Standards), Title 47 (Federal Communication Regulation pending), Arizona Traffic Laws (in it's
        entirety), Arizona Property Statutes (Title 33), HIPAA, tax regulations, dozens of apriori relevant to main
        stream outcomes, dozens of encyclopedia entries related to law and regulation.</li>
      <!-- some people that experience this level of fear kill themselves, remembering https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etika and https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz their end came too soon before the light could reach them, also remembering Goysha, my wife's friend was as brilliant as they come, sometimes the saddness in the world is too much for people. Personally, I can't earn an honorary doctorate of psychology, or a nobel prize if I'm dead, prehaps this gives me transhumanist ambition? I said to Stephen, "this world is too small for a man of my ambition", a quote from Big Fish. The devil is in the detail, i'm very detail oriented, i don't see this as ironic, it's very intentional, this was planned for a long time, God is a programmer, indentured servituted is my punishment for treating the Justice Department like a confessional. -->
      <li>Overcoming childhood trauma and prayer as a methodology for improving memory retention (in progress). Taking
        notes on oscillating thought every second. It appears that thinking about possibility or planning the future is
        the opposite of living in the moment. Possible expansion of intuition by oscillating between possibility and
        then focusing on the moment, blurring vision of current scenery, then focusing on nothing, even the word
        "nothing" in my mind to detach. Hard to oscillate at 60 BPM, might be the key to controlling theta waves.
        Putting slight pressure with my hand on the back of my head helps to clear thoughts, might help with motion
        sickness. Indictation not to pop my knuckles or crack my joints, conflict with chiropracty (in progress)?</li>
