    <!-- am i the only person in the world to write this based on personal experience instead of professional experience? -->
    <ul>
      <li>In my role as a <u>Software Engineer</u> for a start-up medical company, EPIC Research and Diagnostics, I
        exercised the full extent of my <u>Computer Science</u> expertise. During my tenure I was involved in
        <u>computer programming</u> a medical kiosk, this simplified the workflow and necessary security components by
        heavily restricting access to internal systems on the Windows based workstation accompanying the medical
        scanning device. This was a homebrew <u>user-experience</u> that tailored low-level Windows API function calls,
        as well as Group Policy to prevent tampering, misuse, and common web-browsing security flaws throught the
        clinical trial.
      </li>

      <li>As a <u>technologist</u> Using MatLab native compilation, linear regression, and kirlian imaging, I spent
        months studying and rewriting the entire software platform. I was able to reduce image processing time from 10
        minutes to only 10 milliseconds per image. That is a 6,000% performance improvement over the previous version.
        The improved platform was fast enough to run on video image capture from the device. In regard to <u>data
          management</u> in no small part, the performance was improved by systematically redesigning the database model
        to use "near" 3rd-Normal form.</li>

      <li>In additional to these major business goals, I developed, along-side another colleague, an <u>on premise</u>
        internet-based solution for a personal "cloud" service that communicated locally with many connected client
        across multiple physical hospital locations. Doctors would be able to communicate test results as they work from
        different locations in town through the web based (<u>web technologies</u>) service (Microsoft MVC). This
        inspired my propensity for medicine and full-body health and continued research in the field.</li>

      <li>With a development mindset towards body health, I turned my focused on to the mind itself. A former Marine
        approached me with an idea to improve studying for college students. Over the course of 3 years, we designed and
        developed 3 individual products and <u>user expereiences</u> with modern <u>web technologies</u>. We used Drupal
        and Symphony to create an entire course based on study techniques students could implement to improve memory
        retention.</li>

    (3rd Element: Acquired skills - These are skills you want every employer to know
    you possess and feel they are what defines you as a model employee.
    Remember you MUST quantify and qualify every statement you make.)


     Analyze, develop, test and incorporated IT business solutions to enhance
    business process control and tracking. Good Example
     Supervised, motivated, mentored and lead by example, using experience
    backed judgment, strong work ethic, and irreproachable integrity, derived
    from my 12yrs as a Department Manager at ABC Co. Better Example
     Developed and implemented a supply inventory program, which tracked
    our use of production and office materials. This provided us detailed
    reports of our available inventory at all times. Allowing us to make more
    informed purchasing decisions. Resulting in ABC Co. to save 500,000 per
    year. Best Example


    
    EMPLOYMENT HISTORY
    Name of Employer
    Position & Title
    GS level or Salary and Years of Service
    (This section should be identical to skill summary. Write up a brief description of
    duties, and identify your major roles and responsibilities. Describe in detail each
    position you held for at least the last 10 years and quantify and qualify each
    statement).
    TIP: Describe each duty like you are teaching it to someone for the first time. We
    are not allowed to assume you can or can't do anything.
    Ex: Cashier: A cashier can perform numerous duties, if you only list cashier we
    can only interpret that as someone we collected and distributed money).
    As Diversity Manager I analyze develop and manage programs and projects
    related to the successful deployment of our department's initiatives. My duties
    included ensuring we provided an inclusive work environment, free from
    discrimination and ensuring we met all federal and state regulations. This was
    accomplished by collecting, analyzing human capitol data and statistics from
    various sources to get an accurate analysis of the programs and work
    environment we provided our employees. 
     Performed labor market Statistical analysis and employment projections
    locally and nationally to determine our recruitment strategy to ensure we
    were recruiting from a diverse population. Good Example
     Coordinated with our OHR and EEO managers to develop programs to
    improve our diversity in the workplace. We preformed detailed analysis of
    the current workforce, and developed a strategy to ensure we targeted a
    broader workforce. This had an immediate impact on our community
    relations and a 20% increase in local sales. Better Example
     Diversity manager for the past 7 yrs I was responsible for a staff of 20
    employees. I coordinated with our OHR to develop and measure our
    recruiting efficiency, to determine our cost per employee hired and
    accurate ROI. We identified various key elements related to recruiting and
    performed a statistical analysis on how we could reduce our cost per hire.
    This lead to a yearly savings of 15% on our recruiting expenses. Best
